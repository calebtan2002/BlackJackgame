# BlackJack Game
This is a simple command-line Blackjack game implemented in Python. The game allows a single player to play against the dealer, with the added feature of betting using "chips". The player starts with a set number of chips and can place bets on each hand, with the goal of winning more chips by beating the dealer.

## How to Play
Game Rules
The objective of the game is to beat the dealer by having a hand value closer to 21 without exceeding 21.
The player can choose to "hit" (draw a card) or "stand" (end their turn) on their turn.
Face cards (King, Queen, Jack) are worth 10 points, Aces can be worth 1 or 11 points, and all other cards are worth their face value.
The dealer must draw cards until their hand is worth at least 17 points.
If the player or the dealer exceeds 21 points, they "bust" and lose the round.
## Betting System
The player starts with a predefined number of chips.
Before each round, the player can place a bet using their available chips.
If the player wins the round, they receive double their bet amount.
If the player loses the round, they lose their bet amount.
The player can continue to play rounds until they run out of chips or choose to quit.
